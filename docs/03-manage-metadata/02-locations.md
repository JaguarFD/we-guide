## Search for a location
Search for a location by name by typing in criteria in the search box in the left hand corner of the location table.

Click on the column name to sort in ascending or descending order. The column that is being used to sort locations will display a blue arrow next to the column header.


## Bulk location uploads
You can easily create multiple locations by uploading a CSV template with the necessary information. Start by recording location details in a blank template as you set up cameras. Click on the "Download CSV Template" button to download a blank location template to get started. 

Before you upload a bulk location template, please remember to:
- Enter values for all required fields in the template
- If a default value is noted, please enter the default value even if the field is not required.
- The file must be a csv file.
- Check **[location template guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IOTO1-rlP5XJVvs1DhTMH_Ir7rAp8GW7/edit#gid=1160644785)** for full details.

To upload your CSV file:

1. Click on the "Import CSV" button.
2. Select the CSV file that has the location details.
3. Then click the "Submit import data" link that appears next to the "Import CSV" button to upload.
