# Add your team

## Add your team to your Organization or Project
Before a user can access your organization or project, they must sign up and verify their email address. Then you can add them to your organization or project by:

1. Navigating to the organization workspace or project dashboard that you want to add members to. 
    - If you are in the Organization workspace, scroll to the Organization Administrators section.

2. Enter the user's email address and assign them a role. See below for more details on roles and permissions.
3. The role selected will apply only to the entity that you're adding them to. For example, if you are on a specific project dashboard, the user added will be given access only to that project.
