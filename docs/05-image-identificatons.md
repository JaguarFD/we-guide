# Image Identifications

## Select filter options


1. Navigate to the Identify tab to access your project images.

2. Filters make it easy to focus on a smaller subset of images. You can filter images with these options:
    - **Species** 
    - **Subprojects** 
    - **Locations** 
    - **Camera checks**: The camera check option is enabled after selecting a location name.
    - **Identified**: You can also filter indentified or unidentified images.

## Add or edit identifications

1. Click on the thumbnail preview (don't click on the circular checkbox on the top left). A screen will open displaying a larger preview of the image. To the right of the image, under Identify tab, you will see:
    - **Species**
    - **Count:** the number of objects(people or animals) per species seen in the picture.
    - **Remarks**
    - **Add animal** button: You can add another species in case there are more than one species in the image.

2. The Species field will be empty if the image is not yet identified. Fill out the species identication form. Then click the blue **Submit** button. If the image is already identified, then you can edit in this same form and save your changes.


## Image Metadata
Navigate to the Metadata tab  of any individual image. It displays the following: 
    - **Date taken**:  image time capture in 24 hour format (yyyy-mm-dd HH-mm-ss).  
    - **Upload date**: date the image is uploaded to the platform in 24 hour format (yyyy-mm-dd HH-mm-ss).
    - **Uploaded by**: The name of the person who identified the image.
    - **Photo name**: The unique name of the image assigned prior to upload.
    - **Image ID**:  The unique ID assigned to each image uploaded.

## Higlight an image
When viewing an image in large preview mode, you can easily flag it as a favorite for quick access later. In the identification panel, click the Star icon above the word "Highlight" to mark the image.

    - **Species**: Contains the species list, which is linked to the species identified in *Identify* tab.
    - **Age**
    - **Sex**
    - **Side**
    - **Individual**: standardized name of a jaguar
