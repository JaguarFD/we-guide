# Upload Images


## Uploading images to Wild Eyes
Images are linked to their respective camera checks. You can begin uploading by:

1. From your project dashboard, navigate to the "Upload" tab.
2. Select your images by clicking in the white box area with a dashed-line border or drag your images to this area.

3. Select the location where the images were taken. Selecting location helps filter out camera check names that belong only to the selected location.

4. Then select the specific camera check name that the images belong to. It is important that the location and camera check details were already added so that images can be linked properly.
