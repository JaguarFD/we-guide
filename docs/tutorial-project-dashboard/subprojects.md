# Subprojects

A subproject is a grouping of camera checks. You can use subprojects to fit the way that your team works. They also help in breaking down the project into smaller, easier-to-manage tasks. 

## Create a Subproject

**A Subproject can be created similar to how you create camera or location details:**

**1.** From your project dashboard, navigate to the "Details" tab and then click on the "Subprojects" tab.

**2.** If there is no data displayed click on the blue "Add New Subproject" button. If a table exists click the "Insert" button.

**3.** After clicking the "Insert" button, a form will appear.
