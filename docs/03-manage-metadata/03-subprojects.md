# Subprojects
A subproject is a grouping of camera checks, organized to suit your team's workflow. TFor instance, you can use subprojects to group deployments by spatial divisions.

1. From your project dashboard, navigate to the "Details" tab and then click on the "Subprojects" tab.

2. Click on the "Add New Subproject" button or the "Insert" button.

3. After clicking the "Insert" button, a form will appear.

## Search for a subproject
Search for a subproject by name by typing in the search box in the left hand corner of the subproject table.

## Sort subprojects
Click on the column name to sort in ascending or descending order. The column that is being used to sort suprojects will display a blue arrow next to the column header.

## Bulk subproject uploads
You can easily create multiple subprojects by uploading a CSV template with the necessary information. Start by recording subproject details in a blank template as you set up cameras. Click on the "Download CSV Template" button to download a blank subproject template to get started.  

Before you upload a bulk subproject template, please remember to:
- Enter values for all required fields in the template
- If a default value is noted, please enter the default value even if the field is not required.
- The file must be a csv file.
