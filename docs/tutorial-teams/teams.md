# Adding team members

## Organization-level members


Organization-level roles are made up of three roles. ***Organization admin***, ***Organization editor***, and ***Organization viewer***. Organization admins can access all project data. The Admin role can add members, change roles and revoke members. However, the Editor and Viewer roles cannot change roles or revoke users.

**To add organization-level roles to members:**

**1.** Navigate to the Organization page.

## Change user roles or revoke users


Organization admin roles can change user roles for both organization-level and project-level members. Project admin can only change project-level roles. 

***To change roles:***

**1.** Locate the member from the list of added members.

**2.** Select the role to change. A notification will appear at the top center to notify successful change.

**3.** To revoke users, simply check the box next to Revoked. You can uncheck to unrevoked users.

***Note:*** revoke means that the user will not longer have access to the specific project. If you revoke organization-level members, they will no longer have access to the organization.
